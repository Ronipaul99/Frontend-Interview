Q. What happnes when you put a URL ( https://abc.com/pages) in browser and hit enter? Explain step by step.

Answer - 

    When you enter https://abc.com/pages in your browser and hit enter, here is a detailed step-by-step explanation of what happens behind the scenes until the webpage is displayed:
    
    1. URL Parsing
    The browser first parses the URL https://abc.com/pages into its components:
    
    Protocol: https – indicating a secure HTTP connection using SSL/TLS encryption.
    Domain name: abc.com – the address of the server you are trying to reach.
    Path: /pages – a specific resource or page on the server.
    2. DNS Resolution
    The browser needs to translate the domain name (abc.com) into an IP address, which tells it where the server is located. To do this:
    
    It checks the browser cache for a recent DNS lookup result.
    If the cache does not have it, the operating system makes a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server.
    The DNS server returns the IP address associated with abc.com (e.g., 192.0.2.1).
    3. Establishing a TCP Connection
    Now that the IP address is known, the browser initiates a connection to the server using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):
    
    The browser and server go through a TCP three-way handshake:
    SYN: The browser sends a SYN (synchronize) request to start the connection.
    SYN-ACK: The server responds, acknowledging the request.
    ACK: The browser acknowledges the server's response, completing the connection.
    4. TLS/SSL Handshake (for HTTPS)
    Because the protocol is https, a TLS/SSL handshake occurs to secure the connection:
    
    The server sends its SSL certificate to the browser.
    The browser validates the certificate to confirm the server’s identity.
    Both the browser and server agree on an encryption method and exchange keys to establish a secure, encrypted connection.
    5. Sending the HTTP Request
    With the secure connection established, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server to request the /pages resource. The request includes:
    
    Method: GET, because the browser is requesting a resource.
    Headers: Metadata like User-Agent, cookies, and the host (abc.com).
    Example HTTP GET request:
    vbnet
    Copy code
    GET /pages HTTP/1.1
    Host: abc.com
    6. Server-Side Processing
    When the server receives the request, it processes it:
    
    The server matches the request to the /pages route.
    If it's a static resource, the server locates the HTML file and sends it.
    If it’s a dynamic resource, the server runs the necessary backend code (e.g., fetching data from a database, rendering a template, etc.).
    Once the server has the appropriate content ready, it generates an HTTP response containing the requested data.
    7. HTTP Response
    The server sends back the HTTP response, which includes:
    
    Status code: 200 OK (indicating the request was successful).
    Response headers: Including information about the content type (text/html for HTML pages), content length, etc.
    Response body: The actual HTML (or other resource, like JSON) content for the /pages resource.
    Example response:
    php
    Copy code
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/html
    Content-Length: 5120
    
    <html>
    <!-- HTML content -->
    </html>
    8. Rendering the Page
    The browser receives the HTML response and starts processing it. This involves several steps:
    
    Parsing the HTML: The browser parses the HTML document, creating a DOM (Document Object Model).
    Loading Linked Resources:
    The browser identifies additional resources (e.g., CSS files, JavaScript, images) linked in the HTML via <link>, <script>, or <img> tags.
    These resources are requested in parallel (e.g., making more HTTP requests to load the CSS and JavaScript).
    CSSOM Construction: The browser parses CSS files and builds a CSSOM (CSS Object Model) to handle styling.
    JavaScript Execution: Any JavaScript in the document is executed. If there are <script> tags or external JS files, they are fetched and executed.
    Render Tree Construction: The browser combines the DOM and CSSOM to form a render tree.
    Layout & Painting: The render tree is used to calculate the layout of each element and finally paint the elements onto the screen.
    9. Interactive Features
    After the initial rendering:
    
    JavaScript may continue to run to make the page interactive (e.g., handle button clicks, form submissions, etc.).
    AJAX or Fetch requests might be made for dynamic content without reloading the page.
    10. User Interaction
    Once the page is fully loaded and interactive, you can interact with it (scroll, click, input data, etc.).
    
    Additional Steps:
    Caching: If the resources (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) have caching headers, they may be stored in the browser cache. On subsequent visits, the browser might use cached resources instead of making new requests to the server, speeding up the load time.
    CDN (Content Delivery Network): If the server uses a CDN, the request might be handled by a server closer to you geographically, reducing latency.
    In summary, when you enter https://abc.com/pages, your browser goes through DNS resolution, establishes a secure connection, makes an HTTP request, receives the response, and renders the webpage for you to interact with.

Q.What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS request ?

Answer -

    The primary difference between HTTP and HTTPS lies in security. Here’s a detailed comparison between the two:

    1. Security
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):

    HTTP is an insecure protocol. When data is transmitted using HTTP, it is sent as plain text. This means that anyone who intercepts the data (through a man-in-the-middle attack, for example) can read the content, such as passwords, credit card information, etc.
    It does not provide any encryption, so all information is vulnerable to being intercepted by malicious users.
    HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
    
    HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) or the older SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt data.
    This ensures that even if data is intercepted, it cannot be easily read or tampered with because it is encrypted.
    HTTPS also verifies the identity of the website through SSL/TLS certificates, ensuring that you're communicating with the legitimate server and not a malicious site pretending to be the real one (authentication).

    2. Encryption
    HTTP: Data is transmitted in plaintext, with no encryption.
    HTTPS: Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols, making it secure and unreadable to third parties.

    3. Port Number
    HTTP: HTTP typically operates over port 80.
    HTTPS: HTTPS operates over port 443, which is specifically reserved for encrypted HTTP traffic.

    4. Certificate Requirement
    HTTP: No SSL/TLS certificates are required to establish an HTTP connection. Any server can handle HTTP requests without needing special security credentials.
    HTTPS: HTTPS requires a SSL/TLS certificate issued by a certificate authority (CA). This certificate ensures that the website is legitimate and provides the encryption necessary for secure communication.

    5. Data Integrity
    HTTP: Since the data is not encrypted, it can be intercepted and modified in transit without the server or client knowing.
    HTTPS: HTTPS ensures data integrity by preventing data from being altered during transmission. If the data is tampered with, the connection will be dropped or the user will be alerted.

    6. Authentication
    HTTP: No authentication mechanism is inherent in HTTP. You cannot be sure that the server you’re communicating with is legitimate.
    HTTPS: HTTPS authenticates the website using an SSL/TLS certificate. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks by verifying that the browser is communicating with the legitimate server and not an attacker.

    7. Browser Indicators
    HTTP: Browsers show HTTP connections as "Not Secure," especially on pages with sensitive input fields like login or payment forms.
    HTTPS: Browsers indicate HTTPS connections with a padlock icon in the address bar and show the site as secure. Modern browsers often show warning messages if a site doesn't use HTTPS.

    8. SEO Impact
    HTTP: HTTP websites do not get a ranking boost from Google. Since 2014, Google has given preference to HTTPS sites in search engine rankings.
    HTTPS: Websites using HTTPS get a small ranking boost in Google search results because of the added security and trust.

    9. Speed
    HTTP: HTTP may be slightly faster because there is no encryption overhead.
    HTTPS: HTTPS can be marginally slower because of the encryption/decryption process. However, advancements like HTTP/2 (which is mostly used with HTTPS) have made HTTPS just as fast or faster in some cases than HTTP.

    10. Use Cases
    HTTP: Typically used in non-sensitive contexts where security is not a major concern, although it's becoming less common.
    HTTPS: Required for any website handling sensitive data, such as login forms, payment information, or personal user data. It's now the default standard for almost all websites.

    Example of an HTTP request:
    vbnet
    Copy code
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: abc.com
    Example of an HTTPS request:
    sql
    Copy code
    GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
    Host: abc.com
    (Encrypted over SSL/TLS)
    Summary Table:
    Feature	HTTP	HTTPS
    Security	Insecure, data sent in plaintext	Secure, data is encrypted
    Encryption	No encryption	Encrypted using SSL/TLS
    Port Number	80	443
    Certificate	Not required	SSL/TLS certificate required
    Data Integrity	No protection from tampering	Ensures data integrity
    Authentication	No inherent authentication	Authenticates the website
    SEO Impact	No SEO benefit	Small ranking boost in Google
    Browser Indicator	"Not Secure" warning	Padlock icon, marked as secure

    In summary, HTTPS is the secure, encrypted version of HTTP, offering data protection, integrity, and authentication while HTTP is unencrypted and less secure.
